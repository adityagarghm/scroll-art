# Scroll-Art-Project
Scroll art for Intermediate Com Sci
Citation points: 
movingSymbols was created only by me, citation point of 1. It is a design that expands and contracts as time goes on. 
The ascii spiders were also created by me, so only a citation point of 1 is generated. 
The boxes around the spiders can also be considered art, and they also only generate 1 citation point. 

Design of spider is included, this is the brainstorm of the spider ascii.
